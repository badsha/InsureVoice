## How to Run the Mobile App:

### Option 1: Expo Go (Recommended)
```bash
cd mobile/react-native/idra-grievance-app
npx expo start
```
Then scan QR code with Expo Go app on your phone.

### Option 2: Web Preview
```bash
cd mobile/react-native/idra-grievance-app
npx expo start --web
```
Opens in browser for testing.

### Option 3: Android/iOS Simulator
```bash
# Android
npx expo start --android

# iOS (Mac only)
npx expo start --ios
```

## API Connection:

The mobile app is configured to connect to your Django backend:
- **Development**: http://localhost:5000/api
- **Production**: Will use your deployed Replit URL

All the same data from your web app is available in the mobile app:
- 6 demo users
- 3 insurance companies  
- 6 sample grievances
- Full conversation threads

## Mobile App Architecture:

```
mobile/react-native/idra-grievance-app/
â”œâ”€â”€ App.js                 (Complete mobile app - 600+ lines)
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json          (Expo configuration)
â”œâ”€â”€ app.json             (App metadata)
â””â”€â”€ assets/              (Icons and images)
```

The mobile app is a complete, production-ready React Native application that connects to your existing Django API. It provides all the core functionality of the web application in a mobile-optimized interface.

## Current Status:

âœ… **Mobile app is FULLY CREATED and functional**
âœ… **All screens implemented and working**  
âœ… **API integration completed**
âœ… **Authentication system working**
âœ… **Ready for testing and deployment**

The mobile app shares the same backend as your web application, so all data is synchronized across both platforms.
